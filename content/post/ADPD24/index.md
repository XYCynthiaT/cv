## The ADPD24 conference

This is the exhibition center of the conference venue. On the first floor, there are sponsor booths with many counters and tables interspersed throughout. During breaks, the organizers provide a variety of snacks, desserts, as well as coffee, tea, mineral water, and milk. Lunchtime also offers a rich lunch packed in boxes. The bar tables provide a space for conference attendees to rest and interact. The second floor is the poster display area.
