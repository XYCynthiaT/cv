abstract: 'This study demonstrated that a homogeneous polysaccharide (HPS) extracted from Hawthorn exerted anti-cancer effects on colon cancer cells. Human colon cancer cell line HCT116 were treated with 125–1000 µg/mL HPS for 12 h and subsequent analysis was performed on proliferation and signaling pathways. HPS significantly inhibited proliferation of HCT116 cells when analyzed using WST-1 assay and immunofluorescence staining of Ki-67. Flow cytometric studies revealed that HPS could arrest the cell cycle in the S and G2/M phases and increase the rate of apoptosis. HPS downregulated the expression of Cyclin A1/D1/E1 and CDK-1/2. HPS induced apoptosis on HCT116 cells through upregulation of caspase3, 7, 8, 9 and Fas, FADD, TNF-R1, TRADD, upregulation of caspase3 protein was also observed. HPS has an anti-cancer potential in the treatment of human colon cancer which makes it a potential candidate in functional foods for cancer patients.'
