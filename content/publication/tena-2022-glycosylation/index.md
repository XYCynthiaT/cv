abstract: 'Introduction: There is an increased need for the development of novel blood-based biomarkers for early detection, prevention, or intervention in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study sought to determine whether serum glycopeptide analysis holds potential for identifying novel diagnostics and prognostics of AD.

Methods: The study involved 195 participants, including 96 patients with an AD diagnosis and 99 controls with no cognitive deficit. Utilizing a validated analytical mass spectrometry method, we monitored the site-specific glycosylation of 52 serum glycoproteins.

Results: Partial least-squares discriminant analysis revealed that changes in overall sialylation and fucosylation of serum glycoproteins may be indicators of an AD disease state. Loss of fucosylation of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgG2 was indicative of AD diagnosis. Individual glycopeptide analysis found separation between the AD patients and controls on complement proteins and apolipoprotein B.

Discussion: The results of this study suggest that serum glycoprofiling may be a promising approach for biomarker discovery.'
