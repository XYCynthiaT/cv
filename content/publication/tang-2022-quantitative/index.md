abstract: 'In this work, we developed a targeted glycoproteomic method to monitor the site-specific glycoprofiles and quantities of the most abundant HDL-associated proteins using Orbitrap LC-MS for (glyco)peptide target discovery and QqQ LC-MS for quantitative analysis. We conducted a pilot study using the workflow to determine whether HDL protein glycoprofiles are altered in healthy human participants in response to dietary glycan supplementation.'
