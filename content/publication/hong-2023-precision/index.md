abstract: "Purpose of review: Emerging evidence supports the promise of precision nutritional approaches for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. Here, we discuss current findings from precision nutrition trials and studies reporting substantial inter-individual variability in responses to diets and dietary components relevant to CVD outcomes. We highlight examples where early precision nutrition research already points to actionable intervention targets tailored to an individual's biology and lifestyle. Finally, we make the case for high-density lipoproteins (HDL) as a compelling next generation target for precision nutrition aimed at CVD prevention. HDL possesses complex structural features including diverse protein components, lipids, size distribution, extensive glycosylation, and interacts with the gut microbiome, all of which influence HDL's anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cholesterol efflux properties. Elucidating the nuances of HDL structure and function at an individual level may unlock personalized dietary and lifestyle strategies to optimize HDL-mediated atheroprotection and reduce CVD risk.

Recent findings: Recent human studies have demonstrated that HDL particles are key players in the reduction of CVD risk. Our review highlights the role of HDL and the importance of personalized therapeutic approaches to improve their potential for reducing CVD risk. Factors such as diet, genetics, glycosylation, and gut microbiome interactions can modulate HDL structure and function at the individual level. We emphasize that fractionating HDL into size-based subclasses and measuring particle concentration are necessary to understand HDL biology and for developing the next generation of diagnostics and biomarkers. These discoveries underscore the need to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to HDL management. Precision nutrition strategies that account for personalized metabolic, genetic, and lifestyle data hold promise for optimizing HDL therapies and function to mitigate CVD risk more potently. While human studies show HDL play a key role in reducing CVD risk, recent findings indicate that factors such as diet, genetics, glycosylation, and gut microbes modulate HDL function at the individual level, underscoring the need for precision nutrition strategies that account for personalized variability to optimize HDL's potential for mitigating CVD risk."
